R-snippets
==========

This package includes a selection of R snippets for Sublimetext that I find useful when using R through SublimeREPL

Check out the project page at http://www.jvcasillas.com/code/projects/R-snippets

Just type the trigger and hit the tab key. For example...

```
lm
```

Expands to...

```
# load lme4 for mixed models
library(lme4)

# random intercept and random slope model
modelName <- lmer(DV ~ fixedFactor1 +* fixedFactor2 + (1 + randomSlope|randomInt), data=df)
summary(modelName)

```

## Main triggers

- "plot": templates for plotting in base R
- "edit": options useful for data cleansing and saving
- "desc": descriptive statistics of data
- "ttest": distinct types of t-test
- "aov": distinct analysis of variance models
- "lm": linear and logistic regression
- "lmem": linear mixed effects models

## Extras

- "subset": make subsets of a DF
- "read": read/load/install data/packages into R
- "save": save plots, dfs, tables, etc.
- "tikz": template for creating R plots in LaTeX

**Note** All snippets have the following scopes:

```
source.r, text.html.markdown.knitr, text.tex.latex, text.html.markdown.rmarkdown
```
